           I enjoy everything from classic American sitcoms like Modern Family and 
           How I Met Your Mother to gripping dramas like Breaking Bad and
          Grey's Anatomy. I am also a fan of Anime and Korean Drama. I've watched shows ranging from
           One Piece and Attack On Titan to K-dramas like Descendants
          of the Sun and Goblin. Gaming has also been a big part of my life since I was
          young, I started with a Nintendo DS playing games like Pokemon and
          Fire emblem! Right now, Iâ€™m slowly making my way through the co-op
          adventure, It Takes Two.`,

          wildly; sometimes they love it, and other times, not so much. My most
          recent disaster was a dark chocolate sorbet that was way too bitter, a
          failed attempt to cater to local Singaporean tastes ðŸ«£ I also enjoy
          reading, having recently completed The Courage to Be Disliked, which

      through SHINE Youth and Children Services. Beyond volunteering, I enjoy

        Iâ€™ve had the chance to share my journey as a computer science student
